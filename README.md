## TOKENOMICS

### SAFETY FOR INVESTORS

a) Buy/sell orders have a maximum of 1% of the total supply. No whale can pull the rug on investors in a single move.

b) Presale maximums are set in such a way that the largest buyer can only purchase 0.5% of the supply.

c) DxSale protocol was used to lock the five creator wallets for 2 years. Each creator only gets 0.5% of the token.

d) Tokens get listed in DxSale to guarantee fair launch.

### TRANSACTION FEES

Every transaction will have a fee of 5% which will get distributed in the following manner:

#### 2% --> Charity Wallet
The charity wallet sells into BNB every 4 hours to avoid having large hits into the price of the crypto.

#### 1% --> Liquidity
0.5% Sold for BNB
0.5% Stays in HBM
This pair enters the liquidity pool once a day.

#### 0.5% --> Marketing Wallet
The Marketing wallet sells into BNB every 24 hours to avoid having large hits into the price of the crypto.

#### 0.5% --> Burned
We will deflate the amount of tokens available in the ecosystem in a consistent manner, driving up holder value.

#### 1% --> Redistributed to holders. 
To avoid the pattern of "the rich get richer" that happens when coins get redistributed in proportion of what everyone holds we will redistribute each transaction using one of three patterns that will be selected at random each time:

##### a) Proportional to holdings. 
If you have more tokens you get more of the redistributed amount. We have to feed the Whales.

##### b) Anti-Proportional. 
Amount gets distributed in such a manner that the smallest holders get the biggest rewards. We have to feed the minnows.

##### c) Equalized. 
Every address gets the same amount of tokens put into it. We have to feed everyone involved.
